# Django - tutorial

## Installation

You can find detailed instructions from the Django documentation: [Installation Guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/install/)

If you need assistance, Heidi and Jaakko can help you get setup.

## First project

It's a good idea to create a sandbox in which to try out some of Django's features. A good starting point is the tutorial in the official guide: [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/)

Below are two helpful YouTube-tutorial to with nice projects to practice on:
